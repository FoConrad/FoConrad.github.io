title: About me
subtitle: Enough information to be my best friend
---

Since switching majors my second year of undergrad, Computer Science
has been my main passion. My interests span the topics of Big Data and
Distributed Systems to Machine Learning (specifically reinforcement learning),
to Algorithms and Computational Complexity.

My favorite activity in New York City is exploring, and looking for new restaurants.
I grew up in Minnesota, but was born in New Zealand (which gives me
dual US/NZ citizenship!).

My hobbies include
- Reading (anything from classics, non-fiction, and cartoons). Some recent books I enjoyed:
    - The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City. Jennifer Toth
    - Logicomix: An epic search for truth. Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou
    - Bagombo Snuff Box (short stories). Kurt Vonnegut
- Playing soccer
- Hiking (which was better while in CO, but there is still some hiking in NY)
- Biking (another hobby I've had trouble with in NYC, albeit it's just fear that's held me back)
- Downhill skiing. I have skied at
    - Minnesota (where I learned): Welch Village, Buck Hill, Lutsen
    - Idaho: Sun Valley
    - Vermont: Stowe
    - Italy: Courmayeur, La Thuile

And finally my tax to the internet: a picture of a wonderful cat I had the pleasure to 
look after.

That's about all I'd like to say on the matter.
